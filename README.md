# CarryHelper

Carry Helper is a mod developed by SmileCrystal And Reapo to help Dungeon and Slayer
carriers as well as the people getting carried.

The mod is safe to use (doesnt have any features that are bannable), and open source (as well as free ofc).
If a carrier sent you this Github page you are probably getting carried, and the carrier wants you to use this mod to
make his life easier.

The mod makes dungeon carry runs smoother by showing you the safest spot to stand on in dungeon boss fights to avoid deaths,
and which dungeon rooms dont have any more mobs in them to allow you to do secrets without the risk of dying (at least by a mob).
